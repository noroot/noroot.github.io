# Book: The Four Agreements

* Title: The Four Agreemnets

* Author: don Miguel Ruiz

* Year: 2019

It’s a kind of a mild version of Carlos Castaneda esoteric mechanics, solid and well narrated, this book is about magic of words and mind-pre-programming withcraft. It’s more like “Transurfing of Reality” by Vadim Zeland, and “Mental Traps” by Andrea Kukla, with more specific approach, although this is shortest and maybe most valueable spiritual book.

Those Four Agreements are:

* Be Impeccable with your word

* Don’t take anything personally

* Do not make an assumptions

* Always do your best

Read the book for the explanations, it is absolutley worth it. (I’ve listened it about 5 times)
