# Cartridge game storage for PC

Modern computer games became very heavyweight these days. Here are the top10 games by size on disk.

Quantum Break – 178GB.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare – 175GB.

Destiny 2: Shadowkeep – 165GB.

Red Dead Redemption 2 – 150GB.

Final Fantasy XV – 148GB.

Call of Duty: Black Ops III – 113GB.

Gears of War 4 – 112.3GB.

Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare – 101GB.

Middle Earth: Shadow Of War – 95GB

Deus Ex: Mankind Divided – 77GB

This is a list of AAA grade games(high-quality graphics and other game assets that weigh more than average).

SSD price today is about ~50$-~100$ for 250GB-500GB, so it’s almost clear that one SSD disk can fit one game + OS.

For end-user, it’s almost nonsense to have a computer that can handle only one game per time, rather than have a console.

My prediction is that publishers will switch to SSD as carrying storage for games,

they will invent a universal proprietary crossplatform cartridge format based on M.2 SATA interface.
