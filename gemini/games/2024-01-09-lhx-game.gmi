# LHX Attack Chopper- sim game from 1990

I used to play this a lot in my early childhood. Games back then were made with passion, love, and attention to detail. Even though computer power wasn’t as high as it is now, especially for sim-like games, some games were pretty immersive.

This game is called “LHX Attack Chopper” it was made in 1990 by Brent “Buzzboy” Iverson. (published by Electronic Arts.)

Buzzboy later designed legendary Chuck Yeager’s Air Combat.

I remember playing this with my father on an old 386DX CPU. Take a look at this screenshots I made recently.
