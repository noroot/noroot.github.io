# PiHole + dnscrypt-proxy = internet sewage filter

Modern Internet is bloated. But it is possible to make it less bloated. You have to install those programs:

* PiHole - will be your dns manager with black and white lists;

* dnscrypt-proxy - will be your safe dnsscrypt proxy to encrypted dns servers;

Setup suitable for GNU/Linux and MacOS

Installing PiHole

* Run curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash

Installing dnscrypt-proxy

Follow this https://github.com/dnscrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/Installation-linux

After that you have to say to PiHole to use your

```

dnscrypt-proxy

```

* Setup your DNS server to the address which you’re install PiHole

* Go To https://pi.hole (only resolves if you’re setup your dns IP properly)

* Settings -> DNS (Tab) -> Upstream DSN Servers uncheck everything here

* Settings -> DNS (Tab) -> Upstream DNS Servers -> Custom 1, put here your dnsscrypt-proxy address#port string

Next, goto to your current computer and other devices network connection settings, and set DNS to your

```

pi.hole

```

IP address, (127.0.0.1 if you did it locally).

Done. You’re now using much safer and less bloated internet.

Hints:

* Your daily dns traffic will be cleaner from 10% to 25%

* Very rare some sites or rich web applications may not working, be aware of that.

* Better to install it on seprate raspberry-pi.

Your daily status will look like this (20%! percent of garbage)
