# Baseus H1 headphones reset

If you happen to acquire one of these headphones as a spare (there is no other reason to acquire these poor-quality headphones), you might encounter one of the following problems:

Only one ear is playing sound.

One ear is playing sound from one device, while the other is playing from another (sounds crazy, but that’s the reality; you can hear YouTube from one ear and a podcast from the other if your brain can handle it).

To fix this behavior, you need to reset the headphones. My pair of these headphones ended up somewhere on a shelf, and occasionally I came across them wondering how to fix them because it’s obviously a software problem, and there must be a way to perform a hard reset.

#### The Solution:

Connect the USB-C power cable.

Ensure that it is charging, indicated by a steady red LED light.

Rapidly press the three-dotted button five times.

Make sure that the LED switches to a steady white light.

DONE. After this reset, the headphones will work normally.
