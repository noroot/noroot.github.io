# Installing LetsEncrypt with Kubernetes on Digital Ocean

If expeirience working with Kubernetes on Digital Ocean and you need to install or renew LetsEncrypt certificate you might be struggled with in update.

To manage certificate there is a special tool called

cert-manager

=> https://cert-manager.io https://cert-manager.io

## How it works ?

Cert-Manager requesting letsencrypt to issue new ceritificate, LetsEncrypt verify generated certificate using various types of challenges

Let’s Encrypt supports several challenge types that allow it to verify ownership of a domain before issuing SSL/TLS certificates. These challenges are part of the ACME (Automated Certificate Management Environment) protocol, which is used by Let’s Encrypt and other ACME-compatible certificate authorities.

Here are the three main types of Let’s Encrypt challenges:

### HTTP-01 Challenge

The HTTP-01 challenge requires the web server that serves your domain to respond to an HTTP request at a specific path. The cert-manager or your ACME client will provision a file at the path .well-known/acme-challenge/ on your server that contains a token.

How it works:

Let’s Encrypt asks you to serve a token from http://your-domain/.well-known/acme-challenge/

.

The ACME client (e.g., cert-manager) responds to this request by provisioning the token on your web server (usually through an Ingress controller or a pod).

Let’s Encrypt validates the challenge by making an HTTP GET request to the token URL.

Best for: Domains with direct access to HTTP traffic. This is commonly used with Kubernetes Ingress controllers like NGINX.

Requirements: Port 80 must be open and reachable on your server.

### DNS-01 Challenge

The DNS-01 challenge requires you to prove domain ownership by creating a DNS TXT record with a specific token. The cert-manager or your ACME client will automate this by updating your DNS provider’s records.

How it works:

Let’s Encrypt asks you to create a DNS TXT record _acme-challenge.your-domain with a specific value.

The ACME client (e.g., cert-manager) interacts with your DNS provider’s API to create this record automatically.

Let’s Encrypt queries your domain’s DNS TXT record to verify that it contains the correct value.

Best for: Wildcard certificates (e.g., *.example.com), internal services, and domains where direct HTTP access is not possible.

Requirements: You must have control over the domain’s DNS records, and your DNS provider must support automation via an API that the ACME client can use.

### TLS-ALPN-01 Challenge

The TLS-ALPN-01 challenge allows validation over a custom TLS extension called ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation). This challenge type is specifically for cases where you have control over the server’s TLS configuration and don’t want to use HTTP or DNS-based validation.

How it works:

The ACME client (e.g., cert-manager) configures your web server to respond to TLS connections with a special ALPN protocol (acme-tls/1) and a certificate containing the challenge token.

Let’s Encrypt connects to your server over HTTPS and validates the challenge by verifying the presence of this certificate using the ALPN protocol.

Best for: Environments with strict security policies where serving files over HTTP is not an option or where DNS automation is not available.

Requirements: You must have control over the TLS configuration and be able to install the custom certificate temporarily.

Challenge

Description

Best Use Case

Requirements

HTTP-01

Serve a token over HTTP on port 80.

Simple web domains with HTTP access.

Port 80 open and accessible.

DNS-01

Create a DNS TXT record with the token.

Wildcard certificates and internal domains.

DNS provider with API for automation.

TLS-ALPN-01

Respond to a TLS connection with a token via ALPN.

Strict security environments.

Control over TLS configuration.

### Summary of the Process:

Ingress Resource: You define an Ingress resource that cert-manager observes.

Certificate Request: cert-manager issues a request to Let’s Encrypt.

ACME Challenge: cert-manager fulfills the HTTP-01 or DNS-01 challenge to prove domain ownership.

Challenge Validation: Let’s Encrypt validates the challenge.

Certificate Issuance: Let’s Encrypt issues the certificate, and cert-manager stores it as a Kubernetes Secret.

Ingress Controller: The Ingress controller terminates TLS for incoming HTTPS traffic using the issued certificate.

Automated Renewal: cert-manager automatically renews certificates before they expire.

```

DNS-01

```

requires api access to change DNS configuration, which is why everybody uses HTTP-01 challenge which is just a request of a created file on server.

## Install

There is a few ways to install

cert-manager

, one of them is directly with

```

kubectl apply -f ...

```

command.

```

kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.16.0/cert-manager.yaml`

```

Install

JetStack

```

helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io --force-update

```

Install

cert-manager

```

helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \

--namespace cert-manager \

--create-namespace \

-version v1.16.0 \

--set crds.enabled=true

```

Verify installation

```

kubectl get pods -n cert-manager

```

## The Issue

The problem starts here:

Cmd:

```

kubectl logs -l app=cert-manager -n cert-manager -f

```

Output:

```

E1006 23:14:38.1433441 sync.go:208] "propagation check failed" err="failed to perform self check GET request 'http://example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/<token>': Get \"http://example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/<token>\": EOF" logger="cert-manager.controller" resource_name="example-com-tls-1-622117757-218251542" resource_namespace="default" resource_kind="Challenge" resource_version="v1" dnsName="example.com" type="HTTP-01"

```

As you can see, the cert-manager cannot access the challenge file to verify, at the same time if I go to **http://example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/

** with the browser it will be open without a problem.

#### Why is that ?

```

In this case, Kubernetes networking is too smart for its own good. See upstream Kubernetes issue

An ingress controller service deploys a LoadBalancer, which is provisioned by your cloud provider.

Kubernetes notices the LoadBalancer's external IP address. As an "optimization", kube-proxy on

each node writes iptables rules that rewrite all outbound traffic to the LoadBalancer's external

IP address to instead be redirected to the cluster-internal Service ClusterIP address. If your

cloud load balancer doesn't modify the traffic, then indeed this is a helpful optimization.

However, when you have the PROXY protocol enabled, the external load balancer does modify the

traffic, prepending the PROXY line before each TCP connection. If you connect directly to the

web server internally, bypassing the external load balancer, then it will receive traffic

without the PROXY line. In the case of ingress-nginx with use-proxy-protocol: "true", you'll

find that NGINX fails when receiving a bare GET request. As a result,

accessing http://subdomain.example.com/ from inside the cluster fails!

This is particularly a problem when using cert-manager for provisioning SSL certificates.

Cert-manager uses HTTP01 validation, and before asking LetsEncrypt to hit

http://subdomain.example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/some-special-code,

it tries to access this URL itself as a self-check. This fails. Cert-manager does not

allow you to skip the self-check.

As a result, your certificate is never provisioned, even though the verification URL would

be perfectly accessible externally. See upstream cert-manager issues: proxy_protocol

mode breaks HTTP01 challenge Check stage, http-01 self check failed for domain, Self check always fail

```

```

There are several ways to solve this problem:

Modify Kubernetes to not rewrite the external IP address of a LoadBalancer.

Modify nginx to treat the PROXY line as optional.

Modify cert-manager to add the PROXY line on its self-check.

Modify cert-manager to bypass the self-check.

```

Thankfully to

=> @compumike https://github.com/compumike/

there is a tool called

=> hairpin-proxy https://github.com/compumike/hairpin-proxy

.

All you need to do in case of such problem is to installed into your k8s.

```

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/compumike/hairpin-proxy/v0.2.1/deploy.yml

```

It will setup bypass access for ACME challenge, and certificates will be validated properly.
