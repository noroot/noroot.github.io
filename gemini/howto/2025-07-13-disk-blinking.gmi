# Prevent disk from being indexed by system

When prepping a new backup disk, especially after securely wiping, formatting, and mounting it, you might be surprised to see the disk still blinking — indicating activity. It most probably GNOME indexer, which prepresented by this

```

tracker-miner-fs-3

```

, so check process list for its presence.

```

ps aux | grep -E 'tracker|baloo|mlocate|plocate'

```

## What is tracker-miner-fs-3?

```

tracker-miner-fs-3

```

is part of the

Tracker 3 framework

, a background service used by GNOME to scan filesystems and build a searchable metadata database. It powers features like:

* GNOME Shell search

* Nautilus file search

* File indexing for content, tags, metadata

By default,

Tracker watches all mounted volumes

, including your freshly-prepared backup disk.

## Why This Matters for Backups

If you’re like me, using a clean

```

ext4

```

- formatted HDD for

photo backups

, Tracker is:

* 📈 Consuming disk I/O

* 💾 Creating hidden files like .tracker3/

* 🌀 Interfering with a clean, controlled backup workflow

You probably don’t want your backup volume scanned, tagged, and written to by an automated desktop daemon.

## How to Stop Tracker from Indexing Your Disk

### Prevent Tracker from Touching a Mount

Create a

```

.trackerignore

```

file at the root of the mount point:

```

touch /mnt/photos/.trackerignore

```

Alternatively,

```

.nomedia

```

is also respected by some services:

```

touch /mnt/photos/.nomedia

```

This tells Tracker (and sometimes other indexers) to

ignore the folder entirely

.

### Kill It Temporarily

To immediately stop Tracker:

```

pkill tracker-miner-fs-3

```

It may restart automatically unless disabled via systemd.

### Disable Tracker Permanently (if you don’t use it)

```

tracker3 reset --hard

systemctl --user mask tracker-miner-fs-3.service

systemctl --user mask tracker-store.service

```

You can also stop all Tracker daemons:

```

tracker3 daemon -t

```

> This will disable GNOME file search features system-wide.

### Remove tracker index database

The tracker3 database storage is here: $HOME/.cache/tracker3

The log is here: $HOME/.local/share/tracker/data

```

rm -rvf ~/.cache/tracker3

```

```

rm -rvf ~/.local/share/tracker

```

## How to See What’s Accessing the Disk

To confirm Tracker (or anything else) is touching your disk:

```

sudo iotop

```

```

sudo lsof +D /mnt/photos

```

```

sudo fuser -vm /mnt/photos

```

These tools let you observe file-level access and identify persistent background activity.

## Thoughts

If you’re using GNOME and preparing a backup volume — especially for photos — make sure

```

tracker-miner-fs

```

isn’t working against you. A simple

```

.trackerignore

```

file can prevent unintended indexing, I/O, or metadata writes.

There is an option to setup

udev

to create .trackerignore automatically.
