* DHH Wants to get rid of TypeScript from Turbo 8

There is a good PR thread to read here.

Fully recognize that TypeScript offers some people some advantages, but to my eyes, the benefits are evident in this PR. The code not only reads much better, it’s also freed of the type wrangling and gymnastics needed to please the TS compiler. // DHH

Bun is a new JavaScript runtime written in Zig, a new system language. It’s extremely fast, and beats any other runtime. Despite it existing for years, it only became known in this September.
