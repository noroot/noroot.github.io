# EP-16 FalseTrue Digest

## Intro

Hello everybody, I hope you’re doing well, here is an update for in FT episodes, this one is one starts with new updated format, - I’ll share little more personal information, and write intro each time to cover what is happened during week.

Let’s start. First, I switched from Jekyll to Bridgetown. Here’s the note about it:

=> https://falsetrue.io/updates/2024/06/22/switched-to-bridgetown/ https://falsetrue.io/updates/2024/06/22/switched-to-bridgetown

. I had grown tired of

Jekyll’s

complexity in areas that shouldn’t be complicated, so I started looking for a new engine. I didn’t want to switch to Hugo because I wanted to stay with

Ruby

, so I found Bridgetown:

. The migration itself was very easy; I even managed to rewrite the gallery plugin in about two hours. You can see the gallery results here:

.

I also switched to DigitalOcean and have deployed the blog in multiple places: self-hosted and GitHub Pages ->

As for hardware news, I bought this beautiful keyboard. It’s mechanical, and I’ve modded it with O-rings and silicone grease, so it sounds smooth.

If you want to know about other hardware stuff let me know in the comments. and yeah if you see this bearded gentleman hugging keyboard inside this little screen on a photo, let me know if you know who he is.

By the way, I’ve also switched the commenting system from Disqus to a self-hosted solution, so you can leave comments the old-school way.

I continue to work on “Blueprint” — a book about software development, similar to a body of knowledge type of book. If you find it interesting, let me know by subscribing.

## Stories

* Corporate opensource is dead - It’s done really, because it only relied on pioneer enthusiasts who are rare now.

* Opensourcing DOS 4.0 - This enthusiasts are not done yet. Interesting project about opensourcing the DOS 4.0, who knows why but its interesting to look into source code.

* 24 of April was JS Naked day, and it stands for “The web should work without JavaScript.” - It was a day without JavaScript.

* Notes on privacy and data collection of Matrix.org -

The Matrix protocol and its clients are rotten; you can use them for convenience, but not for privacy—much like Telegram.

* SiliconCompiler Design Gallery - design gallery of various CPU architectures - This is really interesting, CPU architectures blueprints.

## Privacy

* Veilid - framework focused on decentralization and privacy made by CultOfDeadCow (if it rings the bell for you.)

* Startup your own ISP - how to start your own ISP

## AI

* The AI lie - another one arguing about AI and Art. (long read)

* Flux - new AI models which better that StableDiffusion

## Development

* Ruby might be fast than you think - Ruby is fast, if you know how to apply it properly.

* BridgetownRB - the blog engine I’ve switched on.

## IndieWeb

* Fediverse Party - to be aware about federated indie internet

## Software

* Superfile - new terminal filemanager - file manager writting with Go, probably nobody will use it, but it interesting to look into source code.

* Nerdfont - some font substitues - collection of good fonts for terminals and text editors. (I’m still using Terminus btw and found good substituion for it as your may have noticed.)

* docker-phobia - analyzer for docker images - tool to debug docker containers

That’s it for this episode. Comment and share.
