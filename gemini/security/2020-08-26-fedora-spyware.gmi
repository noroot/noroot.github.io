# Fedora browser spyware

Installing Fedora distribution Brave browser be aware of it, - default plugin is changing User-Agent header to track that you’re using Fedora.

Same suitable for fedora’s Firefox, but you can’t change it, it’s compiled in. Details under cut.

For

Brave

you can just disable plugin.

For

Firefox

you have to add specific configuration variable, -

go to

```

about:config

```

add

general.useragent.override

put desired value for your user agent, for instance

```

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 9.0; WOW64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko

```

Why thats an issue ?

Brave was installed from snap, so if that was compiled inside Brave distribution, why not something else can be compiled, you can’t check for everything,

thats why it is very important to compile your software from source code, and be sure it’s not contain of something more harmful.

Firefox tells you everwhere that they are for Privacy, but the same time they remove user-agent option and put marks inside it.
