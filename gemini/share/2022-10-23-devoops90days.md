# 90DaysOfDevOps

> This repository is used to document my journey on getting a better foundational knowledge of “DevOps”. I will be starting this journey on the 1st January 2022 but the idea is that we take 90 days which just so happens to be January 1st to March 31st.

> The reason for documenting these days is so that others can take something from it and also hopefully enhance the resources.

> The goal is to take 90 days, 1 hour each a day, to tackle over 13 areas of “DevOps” to a foundational knowledge.
