# Agile clown show // Linkedin

> The Agile coaching industry has become a parody of itself because of #agileclownshow, using buzzwords without actually providing any substantial value. It's as if they claim to know the solution to a problem but have no understanding of the problem itself. The issue with Agile coaching is not just the lack of expertise, but also the audience and those in charge. Just as a teacher must have experience in a subject to effectively teach it, an Agile coach must have experience in the business world. Simply put, they must have a track record of producing results, both positive or negative, before they can effectively coach anyone. If not then red nose and fancy hair should be the working suit.

> Even more horrible is the fact that agileclowns make new agileclowns each show performed.
