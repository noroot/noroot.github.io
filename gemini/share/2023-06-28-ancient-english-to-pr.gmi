# Ancient english helps closing PRs // Github

I’ve tried to use this ancient english message as a comment for PR review to bring attention

> I bid thee good tidings. I beseech thee to take heed, for lo, several moons have waxed and waned since this comment hath been inscribed, yet it remaineth unresolved. I humbly beseech thee to attend to this matter forthwith, that we may advance the pull request without further delay.

After this message PR was closed, and even branch was deleted due to its obsolete.
