# Lion's gate

“Lion’s Gate” typically refers to an astrological event that occurs every year around August 8th. It is believed to be a time of heightened cosmic energy, with its origins rooted in ancient Egyptian and cosmic symbolism.

### Key Aspects of the Lion’s Gate:

* Timing:

    

      The Lion’s Gate portal opens between July 26th and August 12th, peaking on August 8th.

      This period coincides with the astrological sign of Leo, symbolized by the lion, which is known for its association with strength, courage, and power.

* Cosmic Alignment:

    

      The Lion’s Gate is marked by the alignment of the Earth, the star Sirius, and the Sun. Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, is often associated with abundance, prosperity, and spiritual growth.

      As Sirius rises in the sky (in alignment with the Sun), it is believed to be a time when powerful energies flow between the physical and spiritual realms.

* Spiritual Significance:

    

      The Lion’s Gate is seen as a powerful time for spiritual awakening, transformation, and manifestation.

      It’s a period when individuals are encouraged to focus on their goals, release past negativity, and embrace new beginnings. The energy is said to support personal and collective growth, helping to manifest dreams and desires into reality.

* Numerology:

    

      August 8th (8/8) is significant in numerology. The number 8 is associated with infinity, balance, and the manifestation of material and spiritual wealth. The repetition of the number on this date is believed to amplify these energies.

* Meditation and Rituals:

    

      Many people engage in meditation, rituals, and spiritual practices during the Lion’s Gate to harness the energy for personal growth, healing, and manifestation. This may include setting intentions, visualizing goals, or simply being open to receiving guidance and inspiration.

In essence, the Lion’s Gate is a period of cosmic alignment and spiritual opportunity, offering a potent time for transformation and empowerment.
