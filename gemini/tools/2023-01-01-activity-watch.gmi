# ActivityWatch - open source time tracker

Recently taken a look on this project for automated timetracking based on window titles. There are a lot of solutions for MacOS, and maybe Windows, but since then there was no good solution for Linux, and here it is, fully cross platform project called ActivityWatch

## Features

Tracking: Tracks active application and window title out of the box, more with watchers.

Categories: Get a better overview of your usage by breaking it down into categories.

Browser extensions: Track the active tab using the extensions for Chrome and Firefox.

Editor plugins: Track how you spend time writing code with editor watchers.

Privacy: Data is stored locally and doesn’t leave your device, we put local and privacy first.

Cross-platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.

Synchronization: Sync your activity between your devices. (In Progress)
