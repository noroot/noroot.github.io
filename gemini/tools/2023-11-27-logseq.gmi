# LogSeq - notes taking application

Found this interesting project called LogSeq.

Its hardcore, privacy-first notes taking app, knowledge base, might be even compared to org-roam.

## Features

Markdown,  Wiki-alike, Plain text format

Local first which means it saves everything locally, and if you want it can synchronize

Mobile App for both platforms iOS/Android

Obsidian like intrerface with interlinking and visual graph

It’s org-mode inspired, supports org-mode formatting

Plugins market place with various plugins

Probably will be most popular tool after Obsidian for average ppl very soon.
