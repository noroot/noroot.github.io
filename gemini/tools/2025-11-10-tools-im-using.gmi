# Tools I am using

## OS

* Debian GNU/Linux - My distro of choice for 20 years. Stable, customizable, just works (was’t like that in past).

* MacOS - Since M Silicon introduced, you have to try it because it worth it at least as development machine. Apart from that its bloated, and fully controlled.

## Development

* Emacs - Using emacs for about +15 years, initially it was very hard to adopt, but after 10 years it was essential thing for me.

* Doom Emacs - This particule emacs confiugration set is one of the most popular.

* Org-Mode - Hard to beat tool for information organization, todo lists, and any other text related work, hard to adopt, but worth trying.

* Git - GIT. If you know you know.

* DBeaver - Most feature reach database client, supports pretty much everything

* URXVT - Less bloated terminal

* iTerm2 - Probably best default choice for MacOS

* Make - I use make file for pretty much every project as helper utility to pipline a lot of things.

* PostgreSQL - Database of choice

## Management

* LibreOffice - Spreadsheets are still most usable tool in every project.

* Camunda Modeler - Essential tool for modeling business processes

* PlantUML - Most unix-way and to be honest more conviniet way for me to do any type diagram, even very sophsticated.

* Redmine - Old school Project/Task management tool, - for same work you’re doing with fancy modern tools, if you want self hosted, programmable customizable solution this is a good thing. (Especially if you’re a Ruby programmer)

* Jira - Industry standard, 90% new comers hate it, but this is skill issue. Despite Jira become more bloated, and worse in UX, it still best tools you can use.

## Other

* Firefox - First option for browsing, but it becoming dumber, slower. Still usable though.

* Brave - Good second option, which might become primary.

Lookup for Extended version of this lists on my othe very personal blog.
